# What should you put in Roth account vs personal brokerage

The purpose of this optimization model is to decide what account you should place your assets (IRA vs Roth IRA vs Personal Brokerage) in given an already determined asset allocation.  There a lot of assumptions in order to simplify the model and these assumptions can be easily altered if you wish to do so.

The base model now shows largest growth assets should be put in a Roth IRA while the least tax-efficient assets should be put in a traditional IRA.

### Assumptions:
(these assumptions can easily be edited in the model)

Avg bond yield: 4%

Avg bond appreciation: 2%

Avg stock yield: 2%

Avg stock appreciation: 8%

Avg reit yield: 4%

Avg reit appreciation: 4%

Overall asset allocation: 70% stocks, 10% reit, 20% bonds

Time period: 40 years

Tax rate on bonds/reit distributions = 30%

Tax rate on capital gains = 15%

Compounded once annually

Assume all stock dividends are qualified

X[1]= bonds in personal,
X[2]= stocks in personal,
